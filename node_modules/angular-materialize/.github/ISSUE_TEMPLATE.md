You can use this: http://jsfiddle.net/Lvc0u55v/5757/ as a starting point (although the libraries might be old in that JSFiddle, which is your problem).

Since a lot of issues tend to be people not including all the dependencies,
or some other issue not directly caused by angular-materialize,
you cannot expect us to copy paste code in order to replicate your issue.
If no link to a page where the issue is present is provided,
expect the issue to be closed.
